## Description
Simple note taking app.  Since all the front end was pre-built for the assignment, I won't go over full functionality.  What was built as part of the assignment was the back-end server and 'database'.  This makes it so the app could be deployed on heroku as a full stack website, as opposed to our previous assignments being only front-end deployed via GitHub pages. The server uses express.js to run a server along with several paths for getting, posting, and deleting data to and from the api, as well as simple paths for the two html files.   The 'database' is just a simple json file that gets read and rewritten.
